		It&#39;s not often that I use wine in my cooking because it can be pretty pricey, but something magical happens when you add red wine to beef, and it&#39;s something that I just can not resist.
	
	You can have Goulash/what ever you need2 use up/stew using 23 ingredients and 35 steps. Here is how you cook that.

		Do I Need Red Wine in my Goulash?
	
		I read that goulash is the Hungarian word for Beef Stew.
	
		That explains why it is beef and noodles.
	
		We have branched it away from the traditional beef stew we make My mom&#39;s recipe for Polish Goulash was using large elbow pasta, tomato soup and sautéed onions, celery and green bell peppers.

<h3>Goulash/what ever you need2 use up/stew step by step</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Here&#39;s basically what you&#39;ll need minus the noodles and a few missing components but I added them to the ingredients listed above. Wasn&#39;t really sure what I was going to make exactly at the time but this came out wonderful. Full clean flavor.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Rough chop all vegetables except your garlic and potatoes..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Heat Dutch oven or a pan you have a lid for to med/high heat add oil swirl around pan and allow 1-2 mins. To come up to temp. It will start to shimmer but should not be smoking if so reduce heat and give it a minute or two to drop a little we do not want charred vegetables for this particular recipe. I cook on a glass top now unfortunately sure do miss the flame. All appliances do vary..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add your vegetables and saute for about 5-7 mins untill soft and translucent..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			While sauteing smash and mince your garlic I&#39;ve found that if you process your garlic right before your going to use it the flavor will be much more robust..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Now add your ground beef/pork/chicken/turkey whichever your using and season with salt and pepper..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Mix well breaking your grinds up with your spoon untill no longer pink or untill off white and gray if using P.C.T about 5-7 mins.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Now here&#39;s were cooking process can become debatable we want to really brown up our meat. I don&#39;t mean like a roast or steak but when using ground meat with vegetables a lot of water/moisture cooks out so we want to cook all of that off..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			It takes about 10 mins to achieve this so in all actuality were going to cook our grounds and vegetables for about 17-20 mins. Now what&#39;s left is a very potent infused oil with all our ingredients. Now the very health conscious chef could discard this but I recommend you leave it in for a flavor booster at this point..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Now add your garlic and stir well for 30-60 sec. Any longer the garlic can become bitter. Just untill your wife says what are you making in there smells wonderful!!!.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Now we want to add our tomato paste..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Stir and mix well untill you reach a nice rust color about 2 mins.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add beef stock and stir and incorporate the entire broth making sure all the paste has desolved into the gravy..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add your diced tomatoes or break up your whole stewed with your fingers. I like these better cause for one were cooking for a longer time and they won&#39;t disintegrate into the sauce and secondly it keeps up well with the rough chopped vegetables..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Now add your mild or hot paprika. Keep your sweet on the back burner for now. Stir and incorporate..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Toss in your bay leaves and incorporate..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Bring to a boil then reduce heat to low. Should look something like this..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Cover and crack lid. We&#39;re looking for a slow simmer just a little pop every once in a while..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Set timer for 1 hour and do not stir..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Okay looks good so far except for the oil on top of our gravy..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Spoon out and discard. If you kept the can from the tomatoes put it in there..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Okay oil taken care of pretty much what we left in earlier but it did it&#39;s job for the first hour of the cooking process. Now we&#39;re going to add our dry herbs. The grinder is basil oregano and rosemary or use the measurements above individually. Stir and incorporate..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Cover lid cracked again..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Another hour on the timer..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			In the mean time during your second hour of cooking peel and place your potatoes in a dish filled with water to keep them from discoloring. Cut up your cabbage into 1/4 in strains..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Okay we beeped let&#39;s see how were looking. Looks good now let&#39;s have a taste..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Very very good now it&#39;s time to add our sweet paprika. Stir and incorporate..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Quarter your potatoes and add to pot. Stir stir stir.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add cabbage stir..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Stir untill well incorporated..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Now this last half hour keep the lid off and increase heat to med to cook your potatoes. Now you could crack the lid and keep your low temp in witch I did but the potatoes will take an hour at that temp. So to speed it up med heat 30 min lid off.
